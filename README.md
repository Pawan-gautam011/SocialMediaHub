I  developed a React-based social media app that includes features like creating, updating, deleting and viewing posts. I implemented state management using Redux Toolkit, ensuring that all the posts were stored in the Redux store. Additionally, I utilized local storage to persist the posts even when the browser was refreshed.

To manage the posts, I created a Redux slice where I defined actions like postAdded, postUpdate, and reactionAdded. The postAdded action allowed users to add new posts, while the postUpdate action facilitated editing existing posts. For reactions, I created a reactionAdded action that let users react to posts with different emojis like "like(👍)", "dislike(👎)","love(❤️)" "haha(😂)", "sad(😥)", "Wow(😮)", "Angry(😡)".

For the UI, I designed forms for adding and editing posts with user-friendly features such as input validation and a select dropdown for choosing the author. I used the useSelector hook to fetch data from the Redux store and displayed it on the homepage, where posts were ordered by the most recent date. I also integrated SweetAlert2 to provide visual feedback upon successfully posting or updating a post.

To ensure that the posts persisted across sessions, I used useEffect with localStorage to save the current state of posts every time there was a change. This approach not only provided a seamless user experience but also showcased my ability to combine React and Redux with browser APIs like localStorage to create dynamic and responsive applications.
